Learning HTML/CSS and Version Control

*This is code snippets and testing of code as I'm learning HTML/CSS and onward.*

*All of the code, sweat, and frustration was made by hand using Notepad++*

<blockquote>As I have been expanding my website, learning more and needing to scale page content, I have made different Versions that are accessible through an archive page.  The page has hover-boxes that automatically expand on mouse-over by using the :hover pseudo-class and visibility property.  I have not used any JavaScript, it is entirely made from CSS.</blockquote>
